### Green Space Data Challenge

The Green Space Data Challenge by Georgetown University Massive Data Institute invited participants to explore the connections between green spaces, community well-being, and data-driven insights. Participants will have the entire month of February 2023 to demonstrate the value of green space data by creating analyses, visualizations, and new community indicators.

Access to green space is an essential need and has been found to have important quality of life implications.  While access to green space is not equitable across communities nationwide, it has significant implications for community well-being, and has been found to encourage outdoor recreation, human connection, and positive mental and physical health.(Source from MDI)
